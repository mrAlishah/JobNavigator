"""A free "still open?" signal from company scrapes: a posting missing from the company's board in
two full scrapes in a row is marked closed (open_state); one that comes back is open again.

- Only full scrapes count: every link read by an API that returns the whole board (Greenhouse,
  Lever, Ashby, Rippling, SmartRecruiters, Workday, Oracle HCM, Phenom) and no link failed. Boards
  read page by page up to a cap (Meta, Google, Amazon, Uber, generic pages) never count.
- A scrape that sees less than `MIN_SHARE` of the last full scrape's postings does not count
  either (a page that failed half way); the next one compares with the smaller number.
- New scrape links (another board or filter) start the count again.
- Only the company scrape's own rows (`source == "direct"`) of that company, in the current
  account. The application status never changes.
