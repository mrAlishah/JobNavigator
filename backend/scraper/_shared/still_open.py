"""Is a job's posting still open? Checked where it matters, not on a schedule (direct-links plan, Task 9).

A job is checked when you open it in the feed, open a résumé or cover letter for it, or press
re-check; the answer is kept on the job for a day (`open_state`, `open_reason`, `open_checked_at`).

- Greenhouse, Lever, Workday: their own job APIs (404 = gone).
- LinkedIn: its public job page ("No longer accepting applications"); no session is used.
- Anything else: the job page itself. A 404/410, a redirect off the posting (the posting key is
  lost), or a closed phrase on the page means closed.
- A bot wall, a throttle or an error is `unknown`, never closed: nothing is guessed.

A check never deletes a job or changes its status or an application.
