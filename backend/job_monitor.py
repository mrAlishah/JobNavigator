# ── Background concurrency limiters ────────────────────────────────────────
# One place decides how many background tasks of a kind may run at once. The
# gate is taken in launch_background's wrapper — BEFORE the worker opens its
# first DB session — so N queued tasks cost N cheap coroutines, not N pooled
# connections. Scoring 80 jobs used to fan out 80 tasks that each opened a
# session and then waited minutes on the LLM, which drained the QueuePool and
# left even /health unable to get a connection.

    reachable outside launch_background). A plain Semaphore would deadlock on
